# Attribute-associations-of-municipal-green-bond-yield-spreads-A-demand-perspective
R code and analysis scripts for the study of attribute associations driving municipal green bond yield spreads from a demand-side perspective, including ANOVA tests, association rule learning (ARL), spread calculations, stability analysis, and distributional trend assessments.

# Abstract
Investor demand and bond structuring attributes jointly shape the pricing of green municipal bonds. We introduce a yield-to-maturity–based approach to measuring municipal green bond spreads and apply it to the California market between 2016 and 2024. These spreads are on average positive but turned negative after 2022. Using Association Rule Learning, we identify that positive spreads are associated with taxable, at-par, callable, and long-maturity bonds, whereas negative spreads are linked to more complex combinations including low spreads at issuance, non-callable, tax-exempt, at-premium, and short-maturity bonds. We further demonstrate that international demand matters: stronger bidding in Japanese Treasury auctions systematically raises issuance yields for U.S. municipal green bonds, particularly in higher-order attribute groups. These results show how structuring attributes and cross-border demand jointly shape green bond pricing, offering practical insights for issuers seeking to optimize financing costs and for investors navigating sustainability-driven markets.
